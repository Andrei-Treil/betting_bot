# Welcome
This project is an attempt to analyze NBA games using neural networks in order to make accurate betting predictions. Currently, this project is able to scrape data for a given NBA season to train a scikit MLP. 

Tools for scraping the necessary data as well as generating features and samples are present in ```client.py```. For examples on how to use these tools, see the notebook ```bball_bet.ipynb```.
